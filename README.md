# Description

The project was created to share my current work experience and as my business card. While I know that it is 
standard to have your 'paper' resume to send to a recruiter, I thought that this solution could work well as an 
'early access' of my resume. Such a solution carries one thing, but important to me - it can be easily and quickly updated, so that the information contained here, will always be up to date.

## Technologies used in the project
- React
- JavaScript
- GitHub Actions
